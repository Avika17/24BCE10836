EcoFootprint Calculator: 

It is a simple Java program that helps anyone get a quick, personalized estimate of their annual carbon footprint. It was the perfect blend of practicing my Java skills and building something that actually matters for the planet.

This project calculates:
1.  Transportation: This checks whether you're mainly a driver, a bus/train rider, or a combination. It calculates the CO2 from your commute.
2.  Home Energy: It takes a look at your typical electricity usage to figure out the emissions from keeping your lights on and your gadgets charged.
3.  Diet: This one's simple but powerful! It assigns a footprint based on whether you're a meat-eater, vegetarian, or vegan.

Once you input your details, the calculator will break down your total footprint, which is super useful for seeing where you stand. The coolest feature, though, is how it highlights your biggest contributor(e.g., "Transportation is 50% of your total!") and then spits out a few practical, immediate tips to help you chip away at it.

This whole thing started as a way to drill down on some core Java concepts. It was a fun challenge to see how I could use tools like the Scanner for user input, Maps to store the different emission factors, and switch statements to handle the diet category cleanly.
